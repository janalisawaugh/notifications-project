# love_island_notifications

This flutter project is a notification center. Using Bloc state management, I added functionality to mark a card as read after it has been tapped and filter between read and unread notifications. There is also functionality to delete notifications by sliding the notification to the left.
To run the project, ensure flutter is installed, dependencies have been retrieved with flutter pub get, and a device (Web browser, desktop or emulator) has been selected. It is best to select the run without debugging option.
